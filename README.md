# mid
Middleware for our attendance registry system. The final project for Software Development in the Spring of 2023.
We created as Middleware a few components:
  A database designed to connect students to the classes and class days that they attended, so that professors could easily view each student's attendance. We used Firebase for this purpose.
  A interface so that the other two teams were not connecting directly to our Firebase code and to simplify their process. We made POSTs and GETs for our API after designing the verbs in Postman.
